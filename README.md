# C-Tokens
Tokenizes a phone number using functions from C stdlib  and stdio


Write a program that inputs a telephone number as a string in the form (555) 555-5555. The program should use function strtok to extract the area code as a token, the first three digits of the phone number a token and the last four digits of the phone number as a token. The seven digits of the phone number should be concatenated into one string. The program should convert the area code to int and covert the phone number string to long. Both the area code and phone number should be printed.
